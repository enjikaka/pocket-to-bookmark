# Pocket to Bookmarks

Mozilla is killing Pocket and you get your data export as an CSV file. I'll use Linkding instead and it supports the Netscape Bookmark File Format.

This Deno script converts your CSV export to a Netscape Bookmark File Format-compatible HTML-file, that you can import to Linkding or your browser.

## How to run

1. Add your Pocket CSV file in the root directery and name it pocket.csv
2. Run `deno task pocket`
